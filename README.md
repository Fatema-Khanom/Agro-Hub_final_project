# AgroHub

AgroHub is an advanced platform designed to support farmers by providing real-time weather updates, crop health insights, and other vital agricultural information. Leveraging NASAâ€™s Earth observation data, AgroHub integrates data visualization, machine learning models, mobile app accessibility, and augmented reality (AR) technology to help farmers make informed decisions and optimize their agricultural practices.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Reports:** Get weather updates, including temperature, humidity, and rainfall predictions based on location.
- **Crop Health Monitoring:** Use satellite imagery and machine learning to assess crop health and identify early signs of pests or diseases.
- **Natural Disaster Prediction:** Receive custom alerts for potential natural disasters like floods and droughts.
- **Data Visualization:** Easy-to-understand charts that help farmers track crop progress and optimize resource usage.
- **Augmented Reality (AR):** Display weather data like temperature and humidity through an interactive AR experience.
- **Mobile App Accessibility:** Farmers can access all the key features on the go using the mobile app.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, OpenWeatherMap API, NASA Earth Observation Data API
- **Machine Learning:** Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn for crop health prediction models
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Web), Mobile app integration (coming soon)
- **AR Integration:** AR.js for augmented reality display
